# Sui/Walrus Create React App

This project scaffolds a decentralized application (dApp) for the Sui/Walrus ecosystem using `create-tusk-app`. It sets up a modern React environment with pre-configured tools for building blockchain-based applications.

### Installation

Get started by installing the Tusk dApp template using the package manager `npx`:

```bash
npx create-tusk-app tusk-dapp
cd tusk-dapp
npm run dev
```

This will launch the development server, and your dApp will be ready for further development!
